    <h2>What to Expect With Your New Pet</h2>
    <p class="bold">Becoming a new pet owner is an exciting and life-changing experience.
         Welcoming a furry friend into your home brings joy, companionship, and a sense of responsibility.
          Whether you‚Äôve adopted a playful puppy, a curious kitten, or another beloved pet, this new chapter is filled with learning and bonding.

      <p>Before bringing your new pet home, make sure your space is safe and welcoming.
         Remove hazards like exposed electrical cords, toxic plants, or small objects they might swallow.
          Designate a quiet area where your pet can rest and adjust without feeling overwhelmed.
           Setting up a comfortable bed or crate in a low-traffic area helps them feel secure as they explore their new surroundings.</p>

      <p>Having the right supplies ready makes the transition smoother.
         Basic items include food and water bowls, high-quality pet food, a collar and ID tag, and age-appropriate toys.
          Add grooming tools, a litter box for cats or waste bags for dogs, and a cozy blanket or bed.
           Preparing these essentials ahead of time reduces stress and helps your pet feel at home right away.</p>

      <p>Schedule a vet appointment soon after adoption to ensure your pet is healthy and up to date on vaccinations.
         The veterinarian can check for any underlying issues, discuss diet and exercise, and recommend parasite prevention.
          This first visit also establishes a care routine, making future check-ups easier and keeping your pet on track for a long, healthy life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block">
      <p>Take time to build trust and form a strong bond with your pet through gentle handling, positive reinforcement, and consistent routines.
         Offer treats and praise for good behavior to create a positive connection.
          Being patient and spending quality time together will help your pet feel secure and loved in their new environment.</p>

    <div class="content-block">
      <img src="images/Pet_Training.jpg" alt="Training Pet" />
      <p>Begin basic training and socialization early to set the foundation for good behavior.
         Use positive reinforcement techniques, such as rewarding desired actions with treats or praise.
          Gradually expose your pet to different people, pets, and environments to help them develop confidence and adaptability.
           Consistent training and positive experiences will shape a well-adjusted, happy companion.</p>
